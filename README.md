## Project Overview

Bib Number Detection is an advanced computer vision project aimed at accurately detecting and recognizing bib numbers from images and videos. This repository houses the entire project codebase, including the training dataset, model architecture, training scripts, and deployment tools. The goal is to streamline the process of identifying and cataloging athletes in races and events using automated image analysis.

## Features

- **High Accuracy Detection**: Utilizes state-of-the-art deep learning models for precise bib number detection and recognition.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing images in real-time, making it suitable for daily use.
